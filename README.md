# OnePlus2-invite

OnePlus is a Chinese smartphone manufacturer. The OnePlus 2 (also abbreviated as OP2) is a smartphone designed by Chinese manufacturer OnePlus. OnePlus used an invite system to handle sales of the OnePlus 2, exclusively through the company's website, like the OnePlus One. Within 72 hours of being launched, the OnePlus 2 had already accumulated over 1 million reservations.

Referrals could bump you up in the invite queue of OnePlus2. Using this script, I jump the queue from 7 million to 7k and recieved more than 60 invites.
